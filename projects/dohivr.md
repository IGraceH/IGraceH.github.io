---

The DOH IVR is an interactive voice response application for the Department of Health of Hawai'i I helped develop during my intership at eWorld Enterprise Solutions. Working on this project helped me learn how to use other popular tools for application development.

The DOH IVR was created using Dialogflow, ServiceNow, and Zoom. I mainly worked on the Dialogflow and ServiceNow sides. Dialogflow is a Google Cloud Service, created for the purpose of developing IVRs. ServiceNow also mainly uses JavaScript to define its functions. Over the course of several months, we made changes and deploys according to the Department of Health's needs.

During this project, I became more familiar with ServiceNow and learned how to use Dialogflow. I also had to opportunity to onboard and tutor other new developers and BAs to the team, introducing them to the platforms.
