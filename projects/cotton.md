Daily Pearl Doodles is an art challenge I start in May of 2022. The goal was to draw a finished piece of a character named Pearl every single day and upload them to the internet. I used Tumblr as a platform for this challenge. In October of 2022, starting day 125, I took a break and invited another artist to moderate the doodle blog. Thus, on November 2022 onwards, I am continuing this challenge with a good friend. Currently, we are over 200 days of doodles, passing our 200th drawing on December 22, 2022.

This endeavor challenged me to be effcient in what I draw, while still maintaining quality. It's no argument that more time spent on a piece means higher quality, but if I could nail down the right proportions of the body instantly, it saves a lot of time. This project also gave me an opportunity to experiment with a cuter, 'chibi' style rather than my usual, more realistically proportioned style.

I mainly used FireAlpaca for this challenge because it is the drawing program I am most familiar with. However, I have started to use Clip Studio Paint as well for illustrations.
