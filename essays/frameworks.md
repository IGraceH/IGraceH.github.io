HTML and CSS are a pain to work with. Don't get me wrong, I love working with HTML and CSS. It was learning these two languages that piqued my interest in programming in the first place. Something about creating something that was not just text, but with stylization and colors and images with code was fascinating to me. However, I will admit that the amount of effort put into centering an image is frankly, unnecessarily high.

## Bootstrap 5

Recently, I've been working with Bootstrap 5, a UI framework that uses pre-styled classes to quickly style elements on a page. It has so many options for spacing, responsiveness, styling, and more. Simply assign a Bootstrap class to an element and voila! You've got some styling.

However, learning Bootstrap 5 can be a challenge. There are so many classes to pick from, there are a lot of options to remember. If you're not knowledgeable about what a certain class does, it could cause you a lot of pain trying to figure out why an element has so much padding on one side. That definitely did not happen to me when I first started learning Bootstrap! 

Still, a benefit of using a UI framework such as Bootstrap 5 is that styling and positioning go so much faster. Bootstrap especially has many options for padding and margin customization. While classes like margin and padding can be easily styled through CSS as well, the preset classes from Bootstrap enforce consistency across elements within a webpage. Quasar, another UI framework that I have utilized before, also has a similar structure of classes. Best of all, you can make modifications to the default styling to make your website unique.

My favorite feature of Bootstrap 5 is the forms. Bootstrap's forms come pre-styled, not the little ugly box you see on government websites. Bootstrap input forms are neatly spaced out and slightly rounded for a softer look. Even better, the confirmation buttons and any extra bells and whistles are seamlessly integrated with the input box. It's quick, it's easy, and most of all, it looksÂ *nice*.

## Sounds rather lazy?

<figure class="figure float-end ps-4">
  <img width="500px" src="../img/frameworks/etsy.png" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded border" alt="Etsy homepage.">
  <figcaption class="figure-caption text-wrap" style="width: 500px"> There's also a class called justify-content-space-between, which is possibly the longest class name I have ever read.</figcaption>
</figure>

It's not! It's a technique called "work smarter not harder", I'm sure you've heard of it. Many companies use UI frameworks to construct their websites, whether it be a social media site like Facebook, or a shopping center like Etsy. Looking at Etsy a bit more, Etsy is a big website that supports small creators and shops. Its webpage is simple and elegant, displaying dozens of products from different creators. Inspecting its source code reveals the Bootstrap classes used to style the webpage, like justify-content-center. A prime example of a beautifully designed website using UI frameworks.

With all of its features, I enjoy working with Bootstrap. I just feel so much more efficient using its classes to style my webpage. I am also glad that I am not stuck with just using Bootstrap; I can default back to the usual CSS if Bootstrap isn't quite working out how I wanted it to. Bootstrap's classes are intuitive, useful, and stylish. When done right, UI frameworks are an amazing addition to developing a website.

Centering an image is slightly less of a pain now.
